## Hello!!

Data Science has evolved rapidly since the past decade. While it is important to keep up pace with the recent developements, it is equally important to strengthen the basics more than ever. My name is Sneha and I work as a Sr. Data Scientist with Amazon. The sole objective of this blog is talk about the math, science and art behind data science. The opinion mentioned here are my own and does not represent my employer's. Welcome to my blog!
